            <h3><span>Full-stack Engineer</span> based in West Virginia</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a sophomore at Bluefield State University, majoring in computer science
                with a focus on software engineering. Passionate about solving real-world
                problems, I've developed projects like an emergency report app, a quiz app,
                and a car rental website. I love both frontend and backend development, and
                enjoy working in teams. Outside of tech, I play soccer, fish, and game.

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Sampson, and I am from the vibrant country of Ghana, West Africa. I am currently a sophomore at Bluefield State University, pursuing a degree in computer science with a concentration in software engineering.</p>
                <h2>Education and Achievements:</h2>
                <p>At Bluefield State University, I have taken several relevant courses, including Object Oriented Programming with Java, Web Programming, Linux, Introduction to Cybersecurity, Calculus, and Discrete Mathematics. My dedication to my studies has earned me the honor of being named a presidential scholar for all the semesters I've spent at Bluefield. Additionally, I have the privilege of serving as the Vice President of the International Student Organization (ISO) and am an active member of the computer society. My hard work and commitment have also led me to be a Project Success Ascendium intern twice, an honors scholar, a participant in DevCon24, and a proud member of CodePath and ColorStack.</p>
                <h2>Skills and Technologies:</h2>
                <p>I am proficient in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Linux. Recently, I have also started learning Figma to enhance my design skills. My diverse skill set allows me to work on various projects, combining both frontend and backend development.</p>
                <h2>Professional Experience:</h2>
                <p>I have gained valuable experience through internships at my school, where I worked with Chris Shrader, a networking expert. During these internships, I educated staff about cyber threats, fixed network switches and WiFi in school buildings, and helped resolve any computer issues on campus. I also work as an IT Technician on campus during school days, performing similar tasks.</p>
                <h2>Projects:</h2>
                <p><b>Emergency Report App:</b> This app allows individuals to report injuries and symptoms, providing doctors with valuable information to improve healthcare. It is inspired by the idea that we are the best observers of our bodies and can provide crucial details to medical professionals.</p>
                <p><b>Own It Car Rental Website:</b> Driven by my passion for cars, I created this website to offer a user-friendly car rental service that improves people's lives.</p>
                <p><b>User-Friendly Quiz App:</b> This app aims to assist teachers and students by making grading easier and providing features like score tracking and academic performance analysis.</p>
                <h2>Goals and Aspirations:</h2>
                <p>My career goal is to become a fullstack engineer. I want to be a part of both the frontend and backend of projects, continuously learning and growing to excel in what I do. I aim to create solutions that bring smiles to people's faces by addressing real-world problems through technology.</p>
                <h2>Personal Interests:</h2>
                <p>Outside of technology, I enjoy playing soccer, a sport that keeps me energetic and engaged. When I seek relaxation, I go fishing, enjoying the tranquility it offers. I also love playing soccer video games, combining my passion for the sport with my interest in gaming.</p>
                <p>I am enthusiastic about working in groups and planning projects with friends, always eager to collaborate and bring innovative ideas to life. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
