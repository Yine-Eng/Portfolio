            <p>
                I'm a sophomore at Bluefield State University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in Software Engineering. 
                I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, web development, Linux, and cybersecurity. 
                I've developed dynamic projects like an emergency response app with real-time geolocation, 
                a car rental platform using Google APIs, and a responsive tour booking platform. Outside of tech, 
                I enjoy playing soccer, video games, and fishing. Welcome to my portfolio!

                <p>
                    As a full-stack engineer, I build applications with a focus on usability, performance, and
                    functionality. I have experience in Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, and Linux. 
                    My education at Bluefield State University has given me strong programming fundamentals, 
                    along with skills in version control, API integration, and frameworks like Express.js. 
                    I also work with Figma for UI/UX design and Linux for system management.

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Sampson, and I come from the beautiful country of Ghana in West Africa. I’m currently a sophomore at Bluefield State University, where I’m majoring in computer science with a concentration in software engineering. My journey into technology has been filled with curiosity and a passion for creating tools that make life better for others.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Education and Achievements:</h2>
                <p>
                    At Bluefield State, I’ve been fortunate enough to maintain a 4.0 GPA, earning me the honor of being a presidential scholar every semester. I’ve taken courses like Object-Oriented Programming with Java, Web Programming, Linux, Cybersecurity, Calculus, and Discrete Mathematics, which have helped me develop a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the classroom, I’ve been actively involved in campus life as the Vice President of the International Student Organization, where I’ve had the chance to foster connections between students from all over the world. Additionally, I’ve had the opportunity to intern twice as part of the Project Success program, contributing to various technology initiatives at my university.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Skills and Technologies:</h2>
                <p>
                    I have hands-on experience in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Linux, and I’ve recently added Figma to my toolkit for UI/UX design. I’m driven by a desire to solve real-world problems, and I enjoy projects that challenge me to integrate APIs and create seamless user experiences. I’m particularly skilled at bridging the gap between users and technology by making complex systems intuitive and easy to use.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Professional Experience:</h2>
                <p>
                    As an IT Technician on campus, I’ve managed network infrastructure, repaired devices, and strengthened cybersecurity for over 2,000 users, reducing hardware and software issues significantly. I also had the privilege of working closely with my school’s networking expert, Chris Shrader, where I learned firsthand about the importance of maintaining secure, reliable systems.
                </p>
    
                <h2>Projects:</h2>
                <p><b>Emergency Report App:</b> Inspired by the belief that we are the best observers of our bodies, I created this app to help individuals report injuries and symptoms accurately to medical professionals. It uses a real-time location feature and an interactive body diagram to provide doctors with valuable information, improving healthcare response times and outcomes.</p>

                <p><b>Eazi Tour:</b> This project is for spontaneous travelers who want to explore destinations without prior planning. The platform fetches beautiful images and tourist information from around the world through APIs. Users can select a continent and be inspired for their next adventure.</p>
                
                <p><b>Own It Car Rental Website:</b> My love for cars motivated me to build this dynamic platform, which allows users to book rentals seamlessly by choosing locations, dates, and vehicles. It integrates with Google Places and provides real-time location suggestions, ensuring a smooth and satisfying user experience.</p>
                
                <h2>Goals and Aspirations:</h2>
                <p>
                    My goal is to become a full-stack engineer, creating applications that bridge the gap between people and technology. I’m passionate about projects that solve real-world problems and improve everyday life. Whether I’m developing an emergency app or a travel platform, my focus is always on delivering practical solutions that bring smiles to users’ faces.
                </p>
    
                <h2>Personal Interests:</h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of my love for technology, soccer is my favorite way to stay active and energized. When I need to unwind, I head out to fish, where I find peace and focus. I also enjoy cooking, particularly experimenting with new recipes, and playing soccer video games as a way to relax and connect with friends.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Collaboration is at the heart of everything I do. I love working with others to brainstorm, plan, and execute innovative ideas. I believe that technology is a powerful tool for change, and I’m excited about what the future holds. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!
